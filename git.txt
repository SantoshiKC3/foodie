i was trying to learn the git and github from chai aur code, 


i have learned the following command

git status
git init

write -> add -> commit


//in write we have to write the code then 

// in add we will add the file  with git add ./frontend/src/App.css
// in git commit we will say git commit -m "custom message"

i am continuing to write add and code until i remember the git command
