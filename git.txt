i was trying to learn the git and github from chai aur code, 


i have learned the following command

git status
git init

write -> add -> commit


//in write we have to write the code then 

// in add we will add the file  with git add ./frontend/src/App.css
// in git commit we will say git commit -m "custom message"

i am continuing to write add and code until i remember the git command


git log // helps to know who committed on what time  and what was the commit
git log --oneline // helps to know who committed thins in short version







//github push garne kasari


git push -u origin main
